## Description

Initially a device, which purpose was to optimize power consumption of energy
generated by solar power plant, at my family house, by heating water in watre
tanks. Rransformed form device to
small system, containing multiple devices. Software is still under development,
PCBs in versions v1.0 were produced and assembled, but didn't made it to run in
target environment. Maybe one day it will come.

As the version 1.0 of this projects waits for its first real life tests, the idea
has evolved. The evolution made it from device to small modularized system, in
which every module is a device with own MCU, communicating over CAN bus with
the main
controller, which will be based on STM32F3, or some iMX6 SOM. Haven't decided
yet.

### Features of rev. 1

- Control algorithm
- Data savings and storage
- Communication - Modbus TCP, RTU and Telnet

### New things and ideas to be brought by rev. 2

- Split all in distributed modules, driven by its own MCUs, which comunicate
over CAN bus, and can do some simple logic by itselves.
- Allow to update formware in submodules by master module
- Master module may be changed to some MCU running under custom Yocto Linux
distro

### What have been done

The rev. 2 idea was dropped. The MCU was changed to STM32G0B1RET6 (same as
nucleo board). Some tries with zephyr os were made, but didn't work out.
Existing code was refactored, and ported to G0 MCU. MCUBoot bootloader was
added. Updating firmware over ethernet is functional, including updates of
Nextion displays.
